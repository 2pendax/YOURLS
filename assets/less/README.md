## YOURLS style
===============

YOURLS design is now built on top of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), a popular
web development framework.

As such, YOURLS utilizes [LESS CSS](http://lesscss.org/), a dynamic stylesheet language.

If you want to modify YOURLS style for your own good or to submit a fix, edit `yourls.less` and
recompile `style.less` to `style.min.css`.  
Other `.less` files should be left unmodified, as they all come as is from Bootstrap.
